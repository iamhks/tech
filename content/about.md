Hi! My name is Hemant Kumar Singh, I use SHER as my alias. I am a computer science major and this blog will be focused on everything computer science. Since, CS in itself is a vast topic, we'll be starting with Cyber Security. There are 3 main categories, namely:

**(i) Cyber Security**

**(ii) Random** 
and 

**(iii)AI**->will be available from 2022-23. 

In case you find some error in the site/information or have sugegstions feel free to write to me at [contact@iamhks.com](mailto:contact@iamhks.com)
